# Welcome to CSCI 200 at Brown!

CSCI 200 is a new course that replaces the former CSCI 160 and CSCI 180. Students will take CSCI 200 after taking CSCI 111, 112, 150, 170, or 190. It will be taught by [Kathi Fisler](https://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/) and [Milda Zizyte](https://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/mzizyte/).

Starting immediately, CS200 will be **offered every semester** (both fall and spring). Hopefully this will create more flexible options for students.

Like the previous 160/180 courses, CSCI 200 will center around data structures, algorithms, analyzing algorithms for performance and social-impacts, and good programming practices.

## Questions and Answers (updated January 2022)

**Who designed the course? Were they biased towards one of 160 or 180?**  
We designed the course over summer 2021 with a team drawn from both courses. The professors who last taught 160 and 180 worked with a team of TAs from the summer offerings of both courses. We had TAs from each course watch lectures from the other to identify differences in terminology and other small nuances that we needed to pay attention to.

**What about the (H)TAs? Will they be balanced across the intro courses?**  
We have six HTAs. Three took 160, three took 180. The staff includes experienced HTAs from 150, 111, 112 and  180. We're paying a lot of attention to maintaining balance across the intro courses.

**What programming language(s) will the new course use?**  
We will start in Java, then migrate to Python later in the semester. Java is better for much of the data-structures content, whereas Python will let us explore when to use different programming styles and constructs on a given problem. We do not assume that you know either of these language before the course starts..

**Won't students from CSCI 150 have an advantage because they already know Java?**  
No. Our intro courses are about more than just programming. Students from 150 and 170 will come in equally, but differently, prepared. CSCI 200 will make heavy use of the following concepts:

|:--|:--|:--|
| **Topic** | In CSCI 150 | In CSCI 170 |
| Implementing and traversing recursive datatypes | | yes |
| Analyzing run-time of programs | | yes |
| Functional programming | | yes |
| Object-Oriented programming | yes | |
| Imperative programming (updating variables) | yes | |

As the table shows, each of CSCI 150 and 170 cover some topics that we rely on in 200, but neither covers them all. Students from CSCI 150 may have a leg-up at first on the programming aspects, but CSCI 170 students will have a leg up on the conceptual aspects. These should balance out fairly evenly given the course organization.

The first two weeks of the course will features two tracks, one for students coming from 111/112/170/190 and the other for students from 150. Each track will give students a foundation in the material that the other track did in the first semester, so that we can further develop those skills for everyone in the bulk of the course.

**Will there be one large lecture?**  
After the first two weeks, yes. Lectures will be interactive, involving a lot of short exercises that you'll work on with those sitting around you, in-class polls, in-class Q&A, etc. You won't just be sitting in an auditorium passively listening. We want lectures to be worth attending in person, even though lecture-capture will be available for review outside of class.

**Will there be section/labs?**  
Yes. There will be a two-hour lab in addition to lecture every week. Labs will have a combination of programming exercises to practice material from recent lectures and time to learn and practice working with new libraries that will be needed on an upcoming project. *Labs will not be a conceptual rehash of lecture content.*

**What will the workload be like?**  
A mix of week-long homeworks (combining programming, analysis, and written questions) and two-week projects. There will also be a midterm and a final focusing on your conceptual understanding of course content. We expect that assignments will take roughly 9-12 hours per week outside of class.

**What will the projects be? Are they the same as in 160 and 180?**  
The homework contents are similar, in that students will be implementing data structures and algorithms. Regarding the projects:

* There will be a decision-tree building project that has elements of the decision-tree projects from each of 160 and 180.
* There will be a project on travel planning (to exercise graphs)
* There will be a project on implementing a search engine with PageRank that has elements of the PageRank/Search projects from each of 160 and 180.
* The Seamcarve project from 160 is becoming a homework.
* The Heap project from 160 was similar to a 180 homework and will remain a homework
